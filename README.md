# exchange-diary

an app for @yifan0102's "wind of computers" class, at yale GRD

a first foray into react native.

### development

Prerequisite: Install node+npm and git.

1. Clone with `git clone`
2. Run `npm install yarn --global` if you don't have yarn on your computer, and install packages with `yarn` 
3. Run `yarn start` to start developing

Expo/React native/something else might prompt you to install xcode if you develop on Mac, 
and you might have to install an app if you want to develop on a mobile phone. If you
don't want to do that you can click the "view in browser" button, but some 
features (animations, mostly) don't work in browsers.
